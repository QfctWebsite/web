									<p>Some new pictures of our golf cart - running on hydrogen! The sensors, monitors, lights, and under-glow are all working perfectly.

We are very excited to announce that we will be showing it off this year at Homecoming. If you come by the University Ave entrance to Grant Hall on the Friday or Saturday, we will be there with our golf cart - please visit us, we are very excited to explain all of the developments of the summer and offer rides. 

This year the golf cart will act primarily as a learning tool and a focus for minor projects, though the elec team will be working hard on the programming involved in developing its tribrid system. Right now the flip of a switch changes whether the power is drawn from the fuel cell or just the batteries, but this year we hope to develop a strong control system that will make this decision smartly and improve the efficiency of the vehicle. 

More details and progress notes to come!</p>

									 <h2><a href="single.html">Making the final touches to the golfcart</a></h2>
								</div>
								<div class="blog-artical-info-text">
									<p>This summer we are very happy to have two SWEP (Student Work Experience Program) students working full time for the team – Mackenzie Wootton and Ian Lemieux. They have been working very hard on two main projects: first, developing introductory courses, tutorials, and organizing other educational resources for team members to learn from this year (developing sort of ELEC 101 and Fuel Cells 101 courses); and second, improving and putting the final touches on the golf cart.

Some background on the golf cart:  Our team’s first large project was the conversion of a small golf cart to run with an alkaline fuel cell. Last year this project was started again with the goal of making it run with a new hydrogen system. After about a year and a half of work by our chemical, mechanical, and electrical team members, the golf cart works again. With a 1kW PEM fuel cell from Horizon, the golf cart runs on either battery power or power from the fuel cell – it currently switches back and forth with the flip of a switch, but this year we hope to develop the system further so that it can monitor itself and switch more efficiently.

A lot of the work this summer has focused on improving the safety systems, the organization, and the documentation of the golf cart. The display and auxiliary system have been redone: now the cart has fully functioning lights (tail lights, reverse lights, head lights, lights inside the ‘hood’ that turn on when the seat is lifted), and a complex display system that alerts drivers to every change in the system (a ready to drive sound, voltage and current monitors, etc).  Will post another update soon that shows the systems and the new changes in better detail!</p>

									 <h2><a href="single.html">Update from the 2015 Competition</a></h2>
								</div>
								<div class="blog-artical-info-text">
									<p> This year definitely ran away without us finding the chance to post too much on the blog! Over the summer we're going to try to fill you all in on our year. We had a really successful year - we got our golf cart running on a hydrogen fuel cell, we took a working electric snowmobile to the SAE competition in Michigan, and we're about to start a couple new big projects this fall. More updates to come, but first here is a recap of the competition from our Stack Team Co-Manager Elyse: Hosted in Houghton, Michigan, the Clean Snowmobile Competition is run by the Society of Automotive Engineers to develop the skills of engineering students and encourage students to improve and innovate within snowmobile design industry. The competition served to bring together hard-working individuals interested in using their hands-on skills and creative reasoning to develop an electrically-powered snowmobiles and, for the Queen’s Fuel Cell Team, it was a success!

On the first day, our team arrived with our 2011 Skandic Tundra LT and the team consulted the judges to ensure that we were meeting the safety requirements they deemed important. Since the industry-approved high voltage disconnect (HVD) had not been installed, the team had to disconnect the high voltage Anderson connections within the battery box before the snowmobile could be operated on. After ordering this part, it was installed on the left hand side of the vehicle to ensure that an accessible element could be removed from the system. As well, the proper rounded corner lugs were installed onto the contactors within the battery box.  At this time, our Snowmobile was ready for the public display and presentation, where the team was featured in a local newspaper. The public display event also provided the opportunity to network with industry professionals from companies including AVL Instrumentation & Test Systems, Inc., Chrysler, BASF, and DENSO.

The technical presentation took placed on March 5th to display the team’s knowledge of our snowmobile system design and the future goals of the team. On Friday, March 6th, the team wrapped-up coding the Arduino and submitted the snowmobile for technical inspection. Unfortunately, the snowmobile did not meet all the criteria to pass the technical inspection and participate in the Draw Bar Pull, Range Test, Cold Start, Objective Handling and Drivability. Essentially, the judges we not completely confident in the design of the snowmobile’s electrical system. While the team did not stay for the banquet to confirm this, we believe we came in 3rd place (only 2 teams passed inspection this year, one of them being the team from Finland with $1.8 million of funding).

The team is excited to report that this is first year we have an operational snowmobile and, the future goals of the team are to work with the judges to pass the technical inspection. </p>
